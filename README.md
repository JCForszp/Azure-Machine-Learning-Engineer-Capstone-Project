*NOTE:* This file is a template that you can use to create the README for your project. The *TODO* comments below will highlight the information you should be sure to include.

# Your Project Title Here

*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.

### Step 2: Model Training and Deployment  

**HyperDrive**  
- I have finished all the TODOS in the hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb file  
- I have used one type of sampling method: grid sampling, random sampling or Bayesian sampling  
- Specify an early termination policy (not required in case of Bayesian sampling)  
- I have tuned at least 2 hyperparameters in my model  
- I have visualized the progress and performance of my hyperparameter runs (Logs metrics during the training process)  
- I have saved the best model from all the hyperparameter runs  
- Take a screenshot of the RunDetails widget that shows the progress of the training runs of the different experiments  
- Take a screenshot of the best model with its run id and the different hyperparameters that were tuned  

**AutoML**  
- I have finished all lhe TODOs in the automl.ipynb file  
- Take a screenshot of the RunDetails widget that shows the progress of the training runs of the different experiments  
- Take a screenshot of the best model with its run id  

**Deployment of the best model**  
- I have deployed 
 as a webservice
- I have tested the webservice by sending a request to the model endpoint
- I have deleted webservice and shut down all the computes that I have used
- Take a screenshot showing the model endpoint as active


### Step 3: Complete the README  
- I have completed all of the required TODOs in the README file


### Step 5: Create a screencast  
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response 
- Demo of any additional feature of your model 
- Add the screencast link to the README file
